## What did I work on today.

- Worked on my personal website Recognizer.
- Created Header component following React's HOC Pattern.
- Used the theme Spotlight made by the Tailwind team to follow best practices on how to create a Next.js template.

## What did I learn today.

- Learned about forwardRefs in React:
> forwardRef lets your component expose a DOM node to parent component with a ref.


Call forwardRef() to let your component receive a ref and forward it to a child component:
```
import { forwardRef } from 'react';

const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {
  // ...
});
```
